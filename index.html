            <p>"Hungarian cuisine is mostly continental Central European, with some elements from Eastern Europe such as the use of poppy, and the popularity of kefir and quark. Paprika is often associated with Hungary and is used prominently in several dishes. Typical Hungarian food is heavy on dairy, cheese and meats, similar to that of neighboring Czech, and Slovak cuisines. Chicken, pork and beef are common, while turkey, duck, lamb, fish and game meats are mostly eaten on special occasions. Hungary is also known for relatively inexpensive salamis and sausages it produces primarily from pork, but also poultry, beef and others. Hungarian Goulash Soup, often imagined as the quintessential Hungarian dish cooked with onions, Hungarian paprika powder, tomatoes, and some green pepper. Carrot, parsley root, potatoes, and pinched noodles are also added."</p>
